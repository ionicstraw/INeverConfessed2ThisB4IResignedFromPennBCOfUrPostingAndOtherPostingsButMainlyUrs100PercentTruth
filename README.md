america the wasteland, if u let it be:

i am just auditing my year and i want to be alone so im not talking to anyone or anything, im just processing the entire yr and what i would have done differently. lots of things.

so anyway, u need to understand this bc i dont know if u do. i was always there to work, i.e. where u are, and if this works out, i am there to work, that's my priority, that's what i enjoy, thats what i take pride in, i just havent been doing things i want to. im not there fk around, i am a serious fking person, and this country is a wasteland, theres nothing it has going on for it aside from a good education and having a good job. everything else, e.g. friends, a nice house, a wife etc. u can find anywhere else in the world, e.g. japan, armenia, greece (when my brother was there last yr, he said there were all these ppl (actually men) that just were unemployed and hanging around -- thats so boring), pakistan (has these mansions ppl live in and thats all they want to do, nothing else but waste away).

u r responsible for being on top of ur problems and ur sh*t, i expect that from u. dont underestimate me bc im younger or dont have a phd, i am telling u i am a very, very serious person, thats how my brain works. i run away from ppl that have chaotic lives. that doesnt mean im not going to help u, but i expect you to be on top of ur shit, all the time.

u didnt meet me at a coffeeshop on some lazy weekend in nyc, u met me at an interview for a developer position (which u guys fked up for me btw)

i will transfer schools if i need to that is if i am getting distracted by ur problems or by anything. im a serious fking person and i want to do everything i wrote about.

i am two things: i like to work and to think and im muslim. ure not hiding anything from me, im going to have access to ur phone. i dont drink, i dont do drugs, i dont hang around trash ppl.

understand all of this. i am like a competitive asian man (like the ones that went to peking university (the "harvard" of china) not trash paul wang type shit), korean/chinese whatever, i am literally asian u know that right?? i can outwork anyone, i can out-wit anyone.

im there to work. i was always there to work.
